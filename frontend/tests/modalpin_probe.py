"""modalpin_probe.py — can a modal actually be pinned and dragged in a browser?

User spec 2026-09-06: "most openable modals in the app should be able to be
pinned to the window and dragged around, like pinned agent windows. this goes
for inboxes, usage, presentations, the docket, etc."

`modalpin.test.tsx` owns the DOM-level contract in jsdom — the store, which
element carries the window, what the handlers write. It cannot answer the half
of this feature that IS layout and input: jsdom paints nothing, has no
`pointer-events`, no `position: sticky`, no scrolling, no text selection and no
real pointer. So this file drives the REAL DocGalleryModal ("presentations",
one of the four surfaces the user named) in Edge, with the real stylesheet, and
asks the browser.

    python -B tests/modalpin_probe.py                  # the shipped code
    python -B tests/modalpin_probe.py --json out.json  # ...and keep the numbers
    python -B tests/modalpin_probe.py --mutant all     # KNOWN-NEGATIVE CONTROLS
        # every named mutant is applied to the current source in memory and
        # MUST make this probe fail; a mutant that measures clean means the
        # check it targets is decorative

WHAT IT CHECKS
  centred    before anything is pinned the surface is exactly what it was: a
             dimmed backdrop that takes clicks, a centred panel, no inline rect
  pin        the pin control turns it into a window WHERE IT ALREADY WAS
             (measureRect), absolutely positioned, geometry in localStorage
  through    a pinned window has no backdrop: a click outside it reaches the
             page behind. CONTROL: the same click while centred closes the
             surface and never reaches the button behind
  drag       a real mouse press-move-release on the title bar moves the window
             by exactly the pointer's delta, and commits it
  clamp      a drag toward the top-left corner and past the right edge leaves
             the whole window inside the browser window
  resize     the SE corner grows the window; the W edge past the minimum keeps
             the EAST edge still
  state      an inner list scrolled and a row selected keep both across a pin
             and an unpin. CONTROL: the scroll offset must be non-zero first,
             or the check is free
  sticky     with the panel itself scrolled, the title bar — the drag handle —
             is still at the top of the window and still drags it
  select     text inside a pinned window can still be selected with the mouse
  escape     Escape closes a centred surface and is ignored by a pinned one
  stack      two pinned windows coexist; a press raises one over the other
  unpin      the surface goes back to centred, with its backdrop

POSITIVE CONTROLS live inside the checks (marked CONTROL above): the
click-through check requires the centred case to behave the OLD way, and the
state check requires a scroll offset it can actually lose. The mutants are the
rest of the proof.

Requires playwright with the msedge channel (same dependency as
confirmfocus_probe / kbdhire_probe).
